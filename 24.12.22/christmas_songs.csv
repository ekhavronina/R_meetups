Christmas stars are in the sky
Sweet the bells of Christmas Eve
Babies, each a kiss receive
Hushaby, goodnight

Babies in their cradles lie
Every one in white is gowned
Hush, make not a single sound

Quiet now the tiny feet
Babies sleep so still and sweet

"A chubby little snowman
Had a carrot nose
Along came a rabbit
And what do you suppose?
That hungry little rabbit
Looking for his lunch
Ate the snowman’s carrot nose
Nibble, nibble, crunch!","A Chubby Little Snowman Lyrics"
"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Then when we first begun

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

Was blind, but now I see","Amazing Grace Lyrics"

Watching o'er your flocks by night
God with man is now residing
Yonder shines the infant light

Sages, leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar
Seek the great Desire of nations
Ye have seen his natal star
Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King

Saints before the altar bending
Watching long in hope and fear
Suddenly the Lord, descending
In his temple shall appear

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Him Whose birth the angels sing

"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with Thee there","Away in a Manger Lyrics"

"Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath’ring winter fuel

‘Hither, page, and stand by me
If thou know’st it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes’ fountain

Bring me food and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear them thither
Page and monarch forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the cold wind’s wild lament
And the bitter weather

Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer
Mark my footsteps, my good page
Tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter’s rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly

In his master’s steps he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas Lyrics"

"I saw Mummy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up 
In my bedroom fast asleep

Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep

Then, I saw Mummy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night!","I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus Lyrics"
"I saw three ships come 
sailing in,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
I saw three ships come 
sailing in,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

And what was in those 
ships all three,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
And what was in those 
ships all three,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

Pray, whither sailed 
those ships all three,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
Pray, whither sailed 
those ships all three,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning?

O they sailed into Bethlehem,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
O they sailed into Bethlehem,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

And all the bells on earth 
shall ring,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
And all the bells on earth 
shall ring,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

And all the angels in heaven 
shall sing,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
And all the angels in 
heaven shall sing,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

And all the souls on earth 
shall sing,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
And all the souls on 
earth shall sing,
On Christmas Day in the
 morning.

Then let us all rejoice again,
On Christmas Day, on 
Christmas Day;
Then let us all rejoice again,
On Christmas Day in the 
morning.

That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heaven's all-gracious King

To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

For lo, the days are hastening on
By prophet bards foretold
When with the ever-circling years
Comes round the age of gold
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world gives back the song
Which now the angels sing","It Came Upon a Midnight Clear Lyrics"

So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing,
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing,
Listen to what they say
That Man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song,
The music seemed to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear the child,
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing,
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing,
Listen to what they say
And Man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day

By and by they find a little nook,
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark,
Mary's little Boy child was born

Long time ago in Bethlehem,
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,
Was born on Christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing,
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore

"Once in royal David’s city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed;
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.

He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor, and mean, 
and lowly,
Lived  on earth our Saviour holy.

And through all His 
wondrous childhood
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly Maiden
In whose gentle arms He lay;
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient,  good as He.

For He is our childhood's pattern;
Day by day, like us, He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless,
Tears and smiles, like us He knew;
And He cares when we are sad,
And he shares when we are glad.

And our eyes at last shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle,
Is our Lord in heaven above:
And He leads His children on,
To the place where He is gone.

Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him; but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high;
Where like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around.","Once in Royal David's City Lyrics"

"You know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid 
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
“Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?”

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (yipee)
“Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You’ll go down in history”","Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Lyrics"

"The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three Wise Men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This star drew nigh to the north-west
O’er Bethlehem it took its rest
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then entered in those Wise Men three
Fell reverently upon their knee
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of naught
And with his blood mankind hath bought

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel","The First Noel Lyrics"
"Jesus our brother, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable rude
And the friendly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our brother, kind and good

‘I,’ said the donkey, shaggy and brown
‘I carried His mother up hill and down
I carried her safely to Bethlehem town'
‘I,’ said the donkey, shaggy and brown

‘I,’ said the cow all white and red
‘I gave Him my manger for His bed
I gave Him my hay to pillow His head’
‘I,’ said the cow all white and red

‘I,’ said the sheep with curly horn
‘I gave Him my wool for His blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn’
‘I,’ said the sheep with curly horn

‘I,’ said the dove from the rafters high
‘I cooed Him to sleep so He would not cry
We cooed Him to sleep, my mate and I’
‘I,’ said the dove from the rafters high

Thus every beast by some good spell
In the stable dark was glad to tell
Of the gift he gave Emmanuel
The gift he gave Emmanuel

‘I,’ was glad to tell
Of the gift he gave Emmanuel
The gift he gave Emmanuel

Sing ting a ling a jingle and kiss me goodnight
Icicles on the window and snow on the ground
Sing ting a ling a jingle till Santa comes round

All the children to dreamland will soon disappear
But there’s one little darling who won’t close an eye
Till you call for the sandman with this lullaby

Sing ting a ling a jingle and kiss me goodnight
Icicles on the window and snow on the ground
Sing ting a ling a jingle till Santa comes round

Till the night before Christmas when Yuletide is here
They can fill you with laughter and then make you cry
But your tears turn to gladness with this lullaby

Sing ting a ling a jingle and kiss me goodnight

Sing ting a ling a jingle till Santa comes round

For a smile is a language we all understand
You can soothe them or scold them your patience they’ll try
But they turn into angels with this lullaby

Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Born a King on Bethlehem’s plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

Worship Him, God most high

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

On Mary’s lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him praise
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Come, have no fear; God’s son is here
His love all loves exceeding
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The Cross He bore for me, for you
Hail, hail, the Saviour comes
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come, peasant, king, to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise the song on high
While Mary sings a lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born

And glory shone around

Had seized their troubled minds
Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind

To you in David’s town, this day
Is born of David’s line
The Saviour who is Christ the Lord
And this shall be the sign

The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
And meanly wrapped in swaddling bands
And in a manger laid

Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song

All glory be to God on high
And to the earth be peace
Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men
Begin and never cease!","While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night Lyrics"
